create unary to register devices
populate with 3 examples manually 1 DONE
created 1 for now, but the server side array supports multipled.  
should i consider mapping them to zones? then the other sensors map to zones?   DONE
consider doing this via user input   NO, i'll keep it in the client as is  DONE


client side streaming
create a sensor taht provides telemetry lux , perhaps 1 per light...     DONE
update server side to accept data and store it.      DONE


the web-client gui 
should contain the 4 zones, 4 lights and 4 senors with the abillity to turn them on and off but also update of the sensors change by automation logic based on sensors
i have create the express-js , deleted uncessary lines and changed to port 8080 
the web-clietn gui, is allowing me to register a new LIGHT. 
i kinda want it to render the already registered lights on the server. and OK allow me to create new ones and modify existing.    
LightData is rendering the array of lights 
need to bring in the telemetry one, with a refresh

bi-directionaly
used to manage light based on telemetry and update status
as in, the light can turn on and off from either client or server side 
the server side is working based on telemetry, need to update client to reponse if action is required.



server side
this will be a broadcast of the status of the lights
going to BroadcastLights to server side and render the status in the webgui in a new view


one the web client is done, i might change client code to allow me to manually updat the Lux readings and transmit
