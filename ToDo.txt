create unary to register devices
populate with 3 examples manually
should i consider mapping them to zones? then the other sensors map to zones?
consider doing this via user input


client side streaming
create a sensor taht provides telemetry temp/lux , perhaps 1 per light...

bi-directionaly
used to manage light based on telemetry and update status
as in, the light can turn on and off from either client or server side 

server side
this will be a broadcast of the status of the lights


the web-client gui 
should contain the 4 zones, 4 lights and 4 senors with the abillity to turn them on and off but also update of the sensors change by automation logic based on sensors
